# Mini Multiplayer Patches!

A silly attempt at patching CLIENT-SIDE network related stuff on b1.7.3.  

Currently it fixes some networking issues, tries to patch some inconsistencies, fixes *most of* the entity movement issue, logs chat messages to client console (like modern), fixes death screen not sending quit packets (exactly what [DeathQuitFix](https://github.com/Lukiiy/DeathQuitFix/) did)...
